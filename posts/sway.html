    <h1>Switching to Sway</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        You heard me. I have officially switched from Hyprland to SwayWM.
        <br><br>
        Why? Because Sway just works. No unnecessary eye candy. No distractions. No constant breaking updates. Just a simple, fast, and efficient tiling window manager.
        <br><br>
        <b>My Sway Journey</b>
        <br>
        Installing it was easy—just install <code>sway</code>. Then remove Hyprland (which also removes xwayland, so reinstall that if needed).
        <br><br>
        Configuring Sway is simple too. The syntax is basically i3, so if you’ve ever used i3, you already know what to do. I threw in Waybar, Rofi, and my Everforest dark theme for good measure.
        <br><br>
        <b>The Philosophy of Sway</b>
        <br>
        Sway doesn’t waste your time with eye candy. No pointless animations, no rounded corners killing battery life, and no blur for the sake of looking "modern." A tiling WM should be minimal and fast—Sway embodies that perfectly.
        <br><br>
        <b>Why I Switched</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Sway is actually minimal.</li>
            <li>I wanted a real wlroots WM.</li>
            <li>It’s easier to configure.</li>
            <li>Hyprland kept tempting me to use eye candy. Sway removes that temptation.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new.</li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>The Only Issue: Screen Sharing</b>
        <br>
        OBS and screen sharing needed an extra step. Unlike Hyprland, just installing <code>xdg-desktop-portal</code> and <code>xdg-desktop-portal-wlr</code> doesn’t work. You have to add these to your Sway config:
        <br>
        <pre>
exec --no-startup-id /usr/lib/xdg-desktop-portal
exec --no-startup-id /usr/lib/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
        </pre>
        <br>
        That’s it. No other issues. Everything else just works.
        <br><br>
        <b>Final Thoughts</b>
        <br>
        Sway is simply better for my needs. If you want a no-nonsense Wayland WM, give it a try.
