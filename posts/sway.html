    <h1>Switching to Sway</h1>
    <br>
<p>
    You heard me. I have officially switched to SwayWM from Hyprland.

    I'll tell why in just a moment, but first let's just go through my "Sway Journey"
<br>
<br>
    Installing it was simple, just install sway?! And then you remove hyprland which in turn removes xwayland alongside it, so might want to install xwayland again.
<br>
<br>

    Configuring Sway is not hard, it has a simple configuration similar to that of i3, which is to be expected, since it is specifically i3 compatible. I just used what I always used, waybar, rofi etc, as well as a colorscheme i've never tried out, everforest, it's nice!
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>What I think, is the philosophy of Sway</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    SwayWM, despite being a "Wayland Compositor" does not have any eye candy, I love this. I know there are projects like swayFX but the whole point of sway, to me atleast is that it is incredibly, not distracting!
    <br>
    Just think about it, animations make everything slower, rounded corners waste battery life (who cares but I thought i'd mention it, still not a fan of rounded corners), and blur is just.. eye candy, nothing else.
    <br>
    The philosophy of a window manager itself is to be faster than a desktop environment and get your things done without touching the mouse. i3 is a perfect example of a window manager, it has no bloat, it's just fast, get's my stuff done and that's it. When back then, i used i3, I did have blur, shadows, rounded corners, etc, with the reason being it's pretty cool to see all of that in a X11 window manager, where you have to get <pre> picom</pre> and configure it, i will never get this feeling with hyprland.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Reasons for me to switch to sway</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>It is simply more minimal</li>
        <li>I'd like a wlroots WM</li>
        <li>It is, somehow, easier to configure</li>
        <li>THIS (sway) is what i've always tried to get in Hyprland, but then forced to enable a lot of the eyecandy, cause if they are there, I wanna use em, If not, good for me.</li>
        <li>I thought i'd try something new</li>

    <br>
    <b>Problems with Sway</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    It ain't all sunshine and rainbows of course, the number one problem I had with sway was OBS and screen sharing.
    <br>
    unlike hyprland, just installing these packages won't work:
    <pre>xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-wlr*</pre>
    <small>*Note, xdg-desktop-portal-wlr as the name suggests, is for wlroots WMs, hyprland uses xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland</small>
    <br>
    <br>
    The one additional step is just adding these commands to autostart like so,
    <br>
    <br>
    <small>In ~/.config/sway/config:</small>
    <pre>exec --no-startup-id /usr/lib/xdg-desktop-portal
exec --no-startup-id /usr/lib/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
        </pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    And there's that. No other problems i face with sway, the ones i did face i fixed.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Conclusion</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sway is just better than Hyprland for me, I do not want to get into a lot of the drama with hyprland, and originally this was a rage decision after getting a banned from the hyprland discord and then "Going back after a day or so", but it's discord who cares.
