    <h1>Hyprland for Beginners!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        So, you want to use Hyprland? Why, though? No, seriously, why? It's a rabbit hole of endless tweaking, broken updates, and eye-candy distractions. If you're still reading this, maybe reconsider your life choices.
        <br><br>
        Instead of wasting your time configuring this headache-inducing compositor, why not check out something actually usable? Like, I don't know... <a href="sway.html">SwayWM?</a>
        <br><br>
        But hey, if you insist on Hyprland, just install it, slap in someone else's config, and pray it works. That's the real Hyprland experience.
        <br><br>

            Seriously, just <a href="sway.html">click here</a> and switch to Sway already.
