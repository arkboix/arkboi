    <h1>Hyprland for beginners!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hyprland! It's a pretty cool wayland compositor and most people wanna use it, first thing they do, install JaKoolit hyprland, if that's your roadmap then stop reading, this is a guide on how you are supposed to craft your own configuration. Let's get started with the basic applications, obviously hyprland itself is not that fun. We'll cover a few essentials for now that is, the bar, the launcher and the terminal. I use waybar, rofi and kitty, here are a few alternatives:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Hyprbar (ags bar)</li>
        <li>Alacritty (terminal)</li>
        <li>Tofi (fast run launcher)</li>
        <li>Bemenu (dmenu-like for wayland)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      you can find even more, but i'll leave that up to you, before we start configuring a few more "nice to have you" programs can be installed, these are usually not "chooseable" but let me explain, when it comes to File Managers, never use nautilus, it just breaks other programs in hyprland, my recommended choice is Thunar or Nemo, both are lightweight and do what a file manager is supposed to do.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Configuring</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      The default hyprland configuration is pretty good, edit it (~/.c/h/hyprland.conf) and change the variables for programs, add waybar in the autostart, change up the keybinds, do all you want, once you are done with that, you can edit your waybar (the top bar), you have to options, use the default one or just make your own, if you want a template to start with, go to <a href="https://github.com/Alexays/waybar/wiki/Examples">https://github.com/Alexays/waybar/wiki/Examples</a> and pick any example you like, in the example it should have a config link, click it, if you see more than a style, config and a script, don't use the cofiguration, i recommend Mubin's Gruvboxed Configuration.
      <br>
      <br>
      Alright, we got that done, now rofi, for rofi i'd just use any of the default themes, if you want a theme, go to <a href="https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi">this repo with a lot of themes</a> and try that out.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now you got a minimal and base hyprland setup, your next step is adding tweaks upon tweaks until it becomes the ultmate system to fit your needs!
