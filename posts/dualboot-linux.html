    <h1>Trying to Dualboot linux with linux</h1>
    <br>
<p>
  Yeah, that is possible and I did successfully do it (kinda). When you hear the word dualboot it is usually Windows and Linux, but Windows sucks for me and it's useless
  to dualboot that but what ISN'T useless is dualbooting linux with linux, this is useful for me who does stuff on a linux system then tests these in another, by dualbooting this is easily achievable.

  First things first, it ain't easy, the worst thing to do is resize your linux partition in linux, you first have to prepare a usb with a live iso file, in this case arch linux of course (btw) and then use something like cfdisk to then resize, didn't work
<br>
<br>
there was lots of more stuff to do than just resize, so i tried if OpenSUSE (my initial dualboot distro) had the option to resize in the installer, nope. So then i just couldn't get it working, so i came across cachyos, looked cool, tried the installer, had the dualboot option and it just ended there, dualboot done
<br>
<br>
Dualbooting cachyos (arch) with arco linux (arch) seems useless, it is, but that's why i did it
