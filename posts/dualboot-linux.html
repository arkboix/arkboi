    <h1>Trying to Dualboot Linux with Linux</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Yeah, it's possible, and I (kind of) did it. When people say "dualboot," they usually mean Windows and Linux. But Windows is a dumpster fire, so why even bother? Instead, I decided to dualboot Linux with Linux.
        <br><br>
        This is actually useful for testing stuff between different distros. But let’s be honest, I mostly did it because I could.
        <br><br>
        First, let’s get this straight—it ain't easy. Resizing a Linux partition inside Linux is like asking for disaster. So, step one: grab a USB and burn an Arch Linux ISO (btw). Boot into it, use cfdisk to resize the partition, and... yeah, that didn’t work.
        <br><br>
        Turns out, there's a whole lot more to it than just resizing. OpenSUSE’s installer didn't offer an easy way to do it, so I gave up on that. Then I stumbled upon CachyOS. Looked cool, had a dualboot option in the installer, and boom—problem solved.
        <br><br>
        So now I have ArcoLinux (Arch) and CachyOS (Arch) dualbooting. Completely pointless? Absolutely. But that’s why I did it.
