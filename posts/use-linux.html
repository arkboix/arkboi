    <h1>You Are Using Linux WRONG!!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Yes, Iâ€™ve seen way too many people install Linux and mess up so badly that it physically hurts. The main issue? They approach Linux with the mindset of a Microsoft employee.
        <br><br>
        Youâ€™ll only enjoy Linux if you embrace it fully. That means ditching proprietary garbage, throwing games out the window, and worshipping at the altar of Free Software. Contribute to open source! Learn Bash! Chant Stallmanâ€™s name three times before installing software!
        <br><br>
        Another common mistake? Using other people's configs without understanding them. I see so many people blindly copying dotfiles from JaKoolitâ€™s Hyprland setup, ML4W, or even mine! Look, I donâ€™t care if you use my dotfiles, but donâ€™t be lazy. One day, youâ€™ll have to do something manually, and if youâ€™ve never touched your system beyond pasting configs, youâ€™re doomed.
        <br><br>
        If youâ€™re one of those people who rely entirely on an "Update" button without knowing how to update from the terminal, imagine this: one day, your login screen vanishes. You freak out. But if you had even basic Linux skills, youâ€™d press <code>Ctrl + Alt + F3</code> and fix it like a champ. If you donâ€™t know what that does, Iâ€™ll let you find out ðŸ˜‰.
