    <h1>You are using Linux WRONG !!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Yes, i've seen so many people install linux and mess up so insanely bad, the main reason being, they are using Linux with the mindset of a Microsoft employee, you'll have fun using Linux only if you use it with the mindset of Richard Stallman, f*ck proprietary garbage, throw games out the window! Use free software! Contribute to open source! That's Linux for you, if you want that, use it, if not, then so be it. I've also seen many people use other's configurations, most importantly JaKoolit's Hyprland dotfiles or ML4W dotfiles or heck, my dotfiles! I don't have a problem with this but don't be lazy, don't expect to just get an installer for everything, you'll need to do something manually one day, so practive configuring linux, fixing problems with linux and more. If you were a linux user who installed someone elses configuration use what you got never tweaked anything doesn't even know how to update and instead clicks the handy dandy update button that the configuration you installed has, one day you wake up to no login screen, you freak out. Id you had a little bit of knowledge and a little bit of experience, you would have straight up no panic attack pressed Ctrl + Alt + F3, ill leave it to you to find out what it does ðŸ˜‰.</p>
