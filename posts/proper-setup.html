    <h1>What even is a proper setup?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        
I actually have no idea whatsoever. It depends on whatever things you like, but that's something we all know. But really, what would be a universal setup?
<br><br>
<b>What I mean by 'Universal'</b>
<br><br>
I just mean something that can be used by everyone, here is the actual defeniton of it though:

<p><blockquote>From dictionary.com: something that may be applied throughout the universe to many things, usually thought of as an entity that can be in many places at the same time.</blockquote></p>
<br><br>
So, just a setup or more specifically a Linux setup that fits everyone's needs, what would that be?
<br><br>
<b>Colors</b>
<br><br>
When it comes to stuff like colorschemes, we are better off using just a pastell version of the TTY standard colors. Any sort of "main color" is gonna break our simple rules of <i>being universal.</i>
<br><br>
So here's a simple colorscheme I have prepared:
<br><br>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Color</th>
        <th>Hex Code</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Background</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #212121;"> </span> Black</td>
        <td>#212121</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Foreground</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #e0e0e0;"> </span>White</td>
        <td>#E0E0E0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accent Red</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #E57373;"></span> Red</td>
        <td>#E57373</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accent Orange</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #F0A47E;"> </span>Orange</td>
        <td>#F0A47E</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accent Yellow</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #F3D06E;"> </span>Yellow</td>
        <td>#F3D06E</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accent Green</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #81C784;"> </span>Green</td>
        <td>#81C784</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accent Cyan</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #80CBC4;"> </span>Cyan</td>
        <td>#80CBC4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accent Blue</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #64B5F6;"> </span>Blue</td>
        <td>#64B5F6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accent Magenta</td>
        <td><span class="color-box" style="background-color: #CE93D8;"> </span>Magenta</td>
        <td>#CE93D8</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
Alright, now we got that covered. 
<br><br>
<b>Window Manager</b>
<br><br>
So now we need a <i>universal</i> WM, I don't think this is possible but we will try.
<br>
We will just use Wayland for now, since it is the modern standards. As for the wayland WM, most defenitely not hyprland, I don't think sway will be featureful for a universal users. So we will just go with, X11?!
<br>
I think Qtile is a great window manager for now, it is configured in python, and it has some great features! So Qtile it is.
<br><br>
<b>Run Launcher</b>
<br><br>
Rofi. No other yap needed.
<br><br>
<b>Terminal</b>
<br><br>
Obviously, kitty is great, for this time, let's try ghostty though!
<br><br>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
<br>
and that's it, that should just be enough for a proper and universal setup!
